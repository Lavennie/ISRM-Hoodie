# ISRM-Hoodie
Hoodie design for the Computer Science and Mathematics programme.

Feel free to use the design for printing class hoodies (or other class merch).
I recommend using .pdf for the printing, since there will probably be issues with .svg (e.g. missing text).

### Helper scripts
There are two helper python scripts that can be used for making color variations:
- **recolor.py** allows changing main (*any color*) and line colors (*black or white*).
  It needs the template files ("template back.svg", "template front.svg", "template front cars.svg") to reside in the same folder.
  From the templates it generates new .svg files with modified colors.
- **svgtopdf.py** makes .pdf copies of all .svg files in the folder.
  Inkscape needs to be installed and added to PATH for this to work.
  Also, shutil has to be installed.
